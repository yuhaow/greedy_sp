To get the figures:
First run "data.R" to get the training data.
Then go to folder "sp", "pc", "ges", "sp_moralize", "pc_moralize" and "ges_moralize" and run the script "./autosub.sh" in each folder. 
Finally run "tpfig.R" to get the plot without prior knowledge of moral graph, and run "tpfig_moralize.R" to get plot with moral graph.
